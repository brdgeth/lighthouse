5. Early adopters are cool, so you need them to kick start word of mouth.
You certainly can’t afford to ignore or antagonize early adopters. They are your early opinion leaders, so they are required to build the image that the rest will follow. The challenge is to attract them with an innovative solution built on great technology while still keeping it usable, timely and cost effective for the rest of us.
Early adopters are a critical but small market segment that must be treated with respect. They can be your best evangelists or your biggest critics at that critical point when you are crossing the chasm to the larger mainstream customer segment.
But don’t ever be become complacent due to excitement and passion from your early adopters. You still need the same reaction from other market segments, and an appropriate marketing strategy for scaling the business into other segments. Ten percent of even a large opportunity can still leave you in the valley of death, rather than the pinnacle of success.
